## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Preview locally:
```bash
python -m mkdocs serve
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to view the documentation.

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

### Option 1: Using mkdocs gh-deploy (Recommended)

The easiest way to publish is using MkDocs' built-in GitHub Pages deployment:

```bash
python -m mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This command will:
1. Build the documentation site
2. Commit the generated `site/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch
3. Push it to GitHub

**Note:** Make sure you have write access to the repository and your GitHub Pages settings are configured to serve from the `gh-pages` branch.

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Build the site:
```bash
python -m mkdocs build
```

2. Copy the `CNAME` file to the `site/` directory (if using a custom domain):
```bash
cp CNAME site/
```

3. Push the `site/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch:
```bash
cd site
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Deploy documentation"
git push -f git@github.com:subscrio/docs.git main:gh-pages
```

### Option 3: GitHub Actions (Automated)

The repository includes a workflow that automatically builds and deploys the docs when you push to `main`. The workflow is at `.github/workflows/documentation.yml`.

## Custom Domain

The site is configured to use the custom domain `docs.subscrio.com`. The `CNAME` file in the root directory contains this domain and will be included in deployments. Make sure your DNS is configured to point to GitHub Pages.
